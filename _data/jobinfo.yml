      Consumes 1 bottle per honey. Gives honey bottles which must
      be exchanged for silver at the human wares merchant.
      May result in getting killed by bees.

      In my experience, the honeycomb allows you to harvest 10 honey before
      getting attention from bees. Your mileage may vary.
