    At its current state, farming is the simplest, easiest, and most consistent
    job in Crown City. Consequently, it is also the job with the least payout.
    The farming job consists of harvesting wheat for the city and
    (if you are a good member of the community) replanting the wheat with your
    watering can for future farmers to harvest.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section-howto"> How to Farm </h2>
  <p>
    Before you can begin harvesting wheat you will need a hoe, which can be
    purchased from the tools merchant in the market. You also are given a free
    hoe upon entering the city for the first time. The material of the hoe
    doesn't make any difference; the wooden hoe is just as good as the
    iron hoe. For replanting you need a watering can, which can be obtained
    for free on-site by right-clicking the blue glass block next to the
    windmill.
  </p>
  <p>
    The farming job takes place in the fields surrounding the flour mill. The
    easiest way to access it is to take the coach to the windmill in North Pass.
  </p>
  <p>
    To harvest wheat, simply right-click the wheat with your hoe. The wheat you
    harvest is automatically collected by your bag of holding and replaced
    with coins as thanks for your contribution to the city's food supplies.
    Harvesting uses about 1&nbsp;point of energy per 3&nbsp;uses of the hoe, and
    pays 7&nbsp;copper for each stock of wheat harvested.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you are finished harvesting the wheat, it is important
    to replant in the places where you harvested. To do this, use your watering
    can to pour enchanted seed-be-grow fluid on farmland. Wheat will grow in a
    3x3 square around where you pour the water. Continue pouring water until
    the wheat is fully grown. Watering the field requires no energy, but gives
    no payout and can only be done in the fields by the windmill because
    the enchantment on the watering can wears off.
  </p>
  <p>
    I suggest the farming job to anyone who wants to grind out their energy
    without the risk of the mining or beekeeping jobs and without having to
    pay attention to minigames like in smithing and cooking.

    Changes to Farming
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using the watering can originally used energy. This was changed so you
      could water the farm for free without using energy.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the city first opened, there were trapdoor blocks over the irrigation
      puddles. This enabled an exploit where you could harvest wheat without
      destroying the block, allowing you to harvest much faster and not have
      to replant.
    </li>
  </ul>
