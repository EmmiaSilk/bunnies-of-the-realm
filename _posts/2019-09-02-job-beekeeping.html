  <p>
    Right now, Beekeeping is the quickest way to earn money. It has the best
    money-per-enegy ratio of all the jobs, and with the help of honeycombs it
    can be one of the fastest jobs. Beekeeping consists of scooping up honey
    from the hive and delivering them to the Human Wares merchant. The only
    catch is the bees, which make it one of the riskiest jobs in the Crown
    City, next to mining.

  <p>
    To scoop up honey from the hive, all you need is an empty bottle. You can
    buy these bottles at the Human Wares Merchant in the market or reuse
    bottles that previously contained drinks. You should also have food on-hand
    to recuperate from the bees' poison. You can make the beekeeping job easier
    with the help of a Honeycomb Apple, which can be obtained from the Glade
    Fruit Basket contract.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beekeeping job takes place in the beehive in Treeven's Canopy. The
    easiest way to access it is by taking the coach to the great tree in the
    hallowed glade. Head into the tree and find the podzol dance pad. You will
    know you have found it when purple sparkles begin to swirl around you.
    Press shift to dance on the dance pad and be whisked away to the canopy.
    You should be able to see the beehive on one of the branches. Climb into
    the branch find a hole that leads to the beehive.
  </p>
  <p>
    To scoop up honey, hop down into the opening of the hive and use an empty
    bottle on the honey blocks inside the tree.  Be careful not to get cornered
    by bees, as they can knock you deeper into the hive and send you to an
    early grave. If you're lucky, you may be able to harvest honey without
    getting stung with their venomous stingers. Once you are done scooping
    honey, (usually you can only safely scoop up one bottle of honey per go),
    jump down to the safety of water down below. Filling a bottle of honey uses
    up 3 points of energy, and one honey bottle can be sold to the Human Wares
    Merchant for 2 silver a piece.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can speed up the process of harvesting honey with the help of a
    Honeycomb. Eat the honeycomb before jumping into the hive. This allows you
    to disguise yourself as a bee and infiltrate the hive. The disguise lasts
    for 30 seconds, and prevents bees from noticing you while disguised. You
    can still be attacked by bees that noticed you before you ate the
    Honeycomb, so keep your guard up. The cooldown on scooping honey is
    3 seconds, so you should be able to safely fill 10 honey bottles before the
    disguise wears off. After using the honeycomb, you have to wait 4 minutes
    before you can use another one.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recommend beekeeping to anyone with an extra honeycomb lying around. I
    also recommend the job to anyone who values efficient energy usage or wants
    to take a risk.

    Changes to Beekeeping
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Filling a bottle with honey originally used 1 stamina on release. This
      was changed to 3 stamina with the introduction of honeycombs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Honeycombs originally had a cooldown of 2 minutes. This was very quickly
      changed to 4 minutes for balance purposes.
    </li>

      Thanks to TheWooper, Tony_Hana, and Niblexis for helping me find the
      duration for the honeycomb and the cooldown timers for the eating
      honeycombs and scooping honey.

      Thanks to WesGutt for writing Beavernomics and BEEvernomics, which I used
      as a reference for previous cooldown and stamina values.
